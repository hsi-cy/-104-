# AutoDataScraperFor104jobresearch
This python script uses selenium, beautifulsoup, pandas libraries to build a web crawler to gather job information.

The target website is 104.com.tw, which is one of the most popular job searching platform in Taiwan. 

The main purpose for this program is to address a pain point of the job searching process, which is opening too many tabs and losing tracks of which one is which one.

With all information scraped in a local database, I can either use python pandas to read it or just use excel to open the csv file I created. This makes a easier process and a cleaner user interface.
